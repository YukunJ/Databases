# <CSCI-SHU 213 Databases> Fall-2020

This is the repository for CSCI-SHU 213 Databases course, done at NYU Shanghai Senior year Fall 2020. The final project is a web-based air-ticket reservation databases system.

Team members: Yukun, Jiang(jy2363) and Zheng, Wang(zw1454)

Tool used: Python Flask + html + CSS + MySQL databases

Short description: the goal of this project is to build a web-based air-ticket reservation system. There are three main characters possible in the system: customer, ticket agent and airline staff. Each has different functionality allowed to be implemented. The general goal is to ensure the separability while querying, inserting and deleting from the database system and simultaneously provides the user with a interactive web-based display window with summary data and visualization.
